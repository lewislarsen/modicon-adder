# Mod Icons

## About
This plugin simply adds moderator crowns to your client locally. **This does not make you a Jagex Moderator or Player Moderator!**

This plugin is meant to be fun and for educational purposes, please use this plugin responsibly and do not be malicious. Thank you to [Fake Iron Icons](https://github.com/thatgamerblue/fake-iron-icon) for being the base for this project as it provided a good starting point.

## Plugin options

Crown type: You can select Jagex Moderator to get a gold crown or Player Moderator for the silver crown.

Other players: By specifying other players names, they will get the crown you have selected too. Only you can see this as it is local.

Show crown next to username: Will add the crown to your username like Ironman modes do.
